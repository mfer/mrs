  \begin{abstract}
    The main objective of this Practical Project is extend and validate 
    the propositions of the Seminar chosen paper. The extension proposed
    is solve other problem with the approximation algorithm studied. And
    the validation are obtained through simulations on best(worst)-case scenarios.
  \end{abstract}
  \section{Introduction}
    The chosen paper \cite{pengjun:2014} solves the Maximum-Weighted Independent Set of Links Problem [{\bf MWIS}]
    using algorithms designed under the protocol interference model. We are interested in the greedy one, called {\bf gWIS}.

    There is a related work on Wireless Communications \cite{olga:2012} in which the authors made a proof (Theorem 4.5) that 
    any algorithm to solve {\bf MWIS} is a constant approximation for the Multi-Rate Scheduling Problem [{\bf MRS}].

    So, our proposed contributions are:
    \begin{enumerate} 
      \item obtaining a constant approximation to the {\bf MRS} through the fast and simple algorithm ({\bf gWIS}).
      \item implementing the {\bf stripWIS} algorithm (which make use of {\bf gWIS}) to simulate best and worst case scenarios
    \end{enumerate}
  \section{Practical Project Tasks}
    This project is divided in two parts: one analytical and other experimental.
  \subsection{Analytical}
    Into this part, 
    the main task is the mapping of the {\bf MRS} \cite{olga:2012} 
    into a kind of input to the {{\bf gWIS} described at \cite{pengjun:2014}.
    This map must preserve the approximation guaratees.
  \subsection{Experimental}
    Simulations will validate {\bf gWIS} in best and worst case scenarios.
    The implementation code is avaiable at github \cite{mfer:gitMRS}.
